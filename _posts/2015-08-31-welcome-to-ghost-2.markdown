### Lists

Bullets
* Use *italics*
* Use **bold**
    * A nested item
* A final item

Numbers
1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

### Links

URLs are automatically linked e.g. http://ghost.org
Or more commonly use `[]()` e.g. [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org).

### Images

If you have already uploaded the file use `![]()` e.g. 

![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)

To show the WYSIWYG features in the right hand page use `![]` e.g.

![A bowl of bananas]


### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.
    .awesome-thing {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
    }

### Ready for a Break? 

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

<input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" />

That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)
