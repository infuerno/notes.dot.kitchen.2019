We bought a jar of strawberry jam at the [Fortnum and Mason](https://www.fortnumandmason.com/stores/stpancras)'s in [St Pancras](http://londonist.com/2015/03/video-secrets-of-st-pancras-international) station and have got into the habit of finishing breakfast with some bread heated in the oven spread with cream cheese, peanut butter and JAM!

It was absolutely delicious. 

After the end of that we moved onto a jar of orange marmalade we had in the cupboard, also pretty good, which we bought on holiday in Cornwall at some point at a National Trust place.

That's nearly finished so we bought a jar of Damson and Raspberry Jam from M&S yesterday.
