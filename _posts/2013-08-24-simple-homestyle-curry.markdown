I bought a book from amazon just before I went to India "50 Great Curries of India". No coincidence. Haven't read the introduction yet, but made the first pre curry, described as a simple homestyle curry. I made it in le creuset, but I chopped the onions too finely and they caught a bit, didn't taste it before adding the chicken and vegetables and then despite the recipe I think I added far too much water. Tasted half decent. Made the "fragrant style" rice to go with it.
