Mac OS modifier keys always seem to confuse me.

I can never work out if ⌥ means the control key or the alt/option key. Upon reading [this blog post on Mac OS X Modifier Key Symbols](http://irreal.org/blog/?p=121), it became more obvious that it **must be the alt/option key** since everything else is relatively obvious. Even the command key, ⌘, is now ubiquitous despite its [Swedish campground origins](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Swedish_Campground.txt).

### Summary

| Symbol | Key | How to remember |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌘ | Command/Apple | Written on the key, ubiquitous |
| ⌥ | Option | By process of elimination |
| ⌫ | Delete | Obvious |
| ⇧ | Shift | Usual symbol |
| ^ | Control | usual symbol |
