When mapping workspaces there are two options: Active and Cloaked. Cloaked hides directories.
Double click on Source Control at the bottom of the project node in Team Explorer to open Source Control Explorer
Click on the local path at the top of the Source Control Explorer to go directly to that folder in windows explorer
What is the "Workspace version" option in Get in TFS?
