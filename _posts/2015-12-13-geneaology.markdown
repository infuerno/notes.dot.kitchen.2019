### Basics
Try to record for each person

* date and place of birth
* names of parents
* date and place of marriage
* names of children
* date and place of death

Ancestor
: A person from whom you are descended - parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents and so on. 

Collateral relationship
: Relationships between individuals who descend from common ancestors but are not related to each other in a direct (or lineal) line. These include brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins. While it is not necessary to trace these collateral lines when researching your family tree, they can often lead you to clues about your ancestors when you have reached a brick wall.

### Charts

Ascendant chart
: An ascendant chart starts with you and moves back through the generations of your ancestors

Pedigree chart
: A type of ascendant chart which most people begin with. Commonly shows 5 generations of data on a single page. This chart only shows your ancestors - there is no room for siblings, multiple marriages, etc. 

Ahnentafel chart
: Another type of pedigree chart in a table or list, presenting the information in a neat compact manner. Not used as much today.

Descendant chart
: Begin with a "progenitor", the earliest proven ancestor in a line. Often used to chart all of the descendants of a specific ancestor (often an immigrant ancestor or the first one living in a specific area or country). 

Family group sheet
: This is the basic worksheet used for genealogical research. While a pedigree chart identifies your ancestry and serves primarily as a culmination of your work, the family group sheet is how you get there. 

Family Group Sheets are essential.

* they serve as a simple means of recording data
* they make it easy to see at a glance what information is known and what is missing
* they serve as a means of easily exchanging information with other researchers

### Recording Names

* Record names in natural order with uppercase surnames e.g. John William SMITH
* Enter women with their maiden name. If the maiden name is not known use the first name only.
* Record nicknames in quotes after the given name e.g. John "Jacob" William SMITH
* Record name changes using a.k.a. e.g. John William SMITH (a.k.a. John William SCHOONER)
* Record alternate spelling with the earlier usage first e.g. John William SMYTH/SMITH

### Recording Dates

* Use the accepted European standard of DAY, MONTH (spelled out) and four digit YEAR
* Use the standard month abbreviations of: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, June, July, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec
* Specify approximate dates as either "about" (abt) or "circa" (ca. or c.)
* Preface the date with bef. or aft. when an event occured before or after a specific date
* Use bet. when an event occured between two possible dates
* If a date can have multiple interpretations e.g. 01/02/1970 use the original date as written and write the interpretation afterwards using square brackets e.g. 01/02/1970 [1 Jan 1970]

### Recording Places

* Record place names from smallest to largest location
* Country abbreviations: http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/codes/
* If only a city is known, consult a gazetteer to find out the county, parish, province etc
* For locations where boundaries have changed record the location at the time of the event (if space permits, the current location may also be recorded) e.g. Beaufort Co. (now Pitt Co.), NC
* Use probable / prob where place information is inferred, for example where place of death is inferred from place of burial e.g. prob. St. Michael, Bristol, Glouchestershire, England

### Sources and Citations

http://genealogy.about.com/od/citing/a/sources.htm

* Recording the full details of the source of *any* piece of information is **crucial**
 * assist others in evaluating your research and let them know what your facts are based on
 * provide a reference in cases where a newly found fact appears to conflict with previous assumptions
 * help you go back to a previously used source when you have missed information or found new details which lead to more information from that source

#### Source Types
Original vs Derivative
: Referring to the **provenance** of a record, **original** sources contribute written, oral or visual information not **derived** (copied, transcribed, summarised) from another written or oral record

Primary vs Secondary
: Within each source, whether original or derivative, **primary** information comes from records created at or near the time of the event from someone with close knowledge of the event. In contrast **secondary** information is from records created some time after the event, or from someone not present at the event.

#### Citations

Go from general to specific

* Author - the one who authored the book, provided the interview, or wrote the letter
* Title - if it is an article, then the title of the article, followed by the title of the periodical
* Publication details - place of publication, name of publisher and date of publication, written in parentheses (Place: Publisher, Date)
volume, issue and page numbers for periodicals
series and roll or item number for microfilm
* Where you found it - repository name and location, website name and URL, cemetery name and location, etc.
* Specific details - page number, entry number and date, date you viewed a website, etc.

Site derivative sources properly by siting the index, website url, book or database which you used and **not** the actual source from which the derivative source was created (although this can be included as information about the derivative source)

### Genealogical Proof Standard

Consists of five elements:

A reasonably exhaustive search for all pertinent information - examine a wide range of high standard sources to help minimise the probability of un-discovered evidence contradicting a conclusion.
A complete and accurate citation to the source of each item used - you can't evaluate an piece of information if you don't know where it came from. Also important to document all sources as found, even if they only corroborate already known facts. 
Analysis of the collected information's quality as evidence
Resolution of any conflicting or contradictory evidence
Arrive at a soundly reasoned, coherently written conclusion
