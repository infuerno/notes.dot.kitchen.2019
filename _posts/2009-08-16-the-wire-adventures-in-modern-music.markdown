My magazine haul yesterday included

- [The Wire: Adventures in Modern Music](http://www.thewire.co.uk/)
- [iDJ](http://www.i-dj.co.uk/)
- [DJMag](http://www.djmag.com/)

Wanted to get another one, can’t remember the name now, but all the CDs were missing (which convinced me the CDs were desirable, so now I really want it). Also discovered after planning my whole shopping route round it that the Borders in Oxford Street no longer exists. Bought [a book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Long-player-Goodbye-Album-Vinyl-Again/dp/0340934115/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250423746&sr=1-1) at [Foyles](http://www.foyles.co.uk "Foyles") to help make sure it doesn’t go the same way.
